==================================================

Dear Detect board members,

I am pleased to provide a general business update to the board now that I have settled into the CEO role for several weeks. I continue to be excited by the opportunity in front of us and impressed by the quality of the team.

Summary: The team is in the midst of integrating a fully functional hardware and software prototype of our next-generation system for use in doctors’ offices, and has established feasibility of our first product on the platform, a Vaginitis panel. I have included a link to a video demo.   Having successfully executed the leadership transition, we have engaged the bank BTIG to help us pursue a Series D fundraise that will capitalize the company beyond our current runway of Q3 2025 and through FDA approval projected in 2026/2027.


Fundraise and Financials
Received board approval and contracted JPM to run a dual process fundraise and M&A, commencing in Q1 2025  
Targeting a $50-75M raise to take us through FDA approval and early commercialization, with potential for cash flow positivity
Monthly actuals continue to track budget projections, averaging $3.5M burn per month
Received BARDA contract extension up to $25M to fund platform development
Estimated runway into September ‘26


Development
In the process of integrating functional hardware and software prototype (Merlin 3)
Decided to prioritize Vaginitis as first product due to high market potential (10-15M tests per year, established reimbursement and high unmet clinical need)
Successfully established feasibility of Vaginitis panel and continuing development
Targeting Q3 2026 for FDA submission date
Received positive FDA feedback via pre-submission regarding cybersecurity plan, platform design suitable for CLIA waiver, and clinical study plans


Team
Made three key senior hires: Jane Stevens and Greg Seire (Principal Scientists, Bioassay Development), and David Venetti (Director of Bioinformatics)
39 full time employees 
I am available for any questions or follow-ups. Thank you for your support and best wishes for the holiday season.

Best,
Eric
